# Dannys_sql_challenge

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is proudly brought to you by the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of the Serious SQL course!

What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

My idea was to create a online community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey.

I also wanted to help everyone start crafting their own personal branding, online presence and a personal portfolio of data projects - and so the 8 Week SQL Challenge was born!
